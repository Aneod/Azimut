# Azimut
A mobile application in Java and Kotlin allowing you to visualize the elevation of the sun in the sky for a given location and time up to the next 24 hours.

The sun elevation is not an approximation nor a fixed value. The app use the solarpositioning library (https://github.com/klausbrunner/solarpositioning/tree/master).

Not available on Google Play Store because testers are required.

## Functionality

By choosing a geographic location (by selection on a map or by geolocation), and by choosing time within 24 hours, you will see a simplistic representation of the sun has a height representing that observed on site and more or less east/west depending on the time chosen.
